## The Questionnaire

The questionnaire is the heart of our matching algorithm. It helps us understand your preferences, values, and what you're looking for in a match.

### Questionnaire Structure

The questionnaire consists of several sections:

- **Demographics & Preferences**
- **Values & Lifestyle**
- **Interests & Hobbies**
- **Personality & Compatibility**
- **Deal-breakers & Must-haves**

### Tips for Filling Out Your Questionnaire

1. **Be honest** - The algorithm works best when you're genuine
2. **Rate importance** - Use the importance ratings to highlight what matters most to you
3. **Take your time** - There's no rush, you can save and return later
4. **Be specific** - Open-ended responses help cupids understand you better

### Importance Ratings

For many questions, you'll rate how important that factor is to you (1-5 scale):

- **1-2**: Nice to have, but not a deal-breaker
- **3**: Moderately important
- **4-5**: Very important, this matters a lot to me

The algorithm weighs your responses based on these importance ratings.

### Saving Your Progress

- Your responses are auto-saved as you go
- You can exit and return anytime before the deadline
- Make sure to click **"Submit Questionnaire"** when you're done!

⚠️ **Important**: If you don't submit your questionnaire by January 31st, you won't be included in the matching process.

## Understanding the Matching Process

UBCupids uses a unique **hybrid matching system** that combines algorithm scores with human cupid review.

### Phase 1: Algorithm Scoring (Automated)

The algorithm calculates compatibility scores between all participants based on:

- **Response alignment** - How similar are your answers?
- **Importance weighting** - Prioritizing factors you both care about
- **Deal-breaker filtering** - Ensuring must-haves are met
- **Bidirectional scores** - Both directions of compatibility matter

### Phase 2: Cupid Review (Human Touch)

Human cupids review the top algorithm matches and:

- Read profile summaries generated by AI
- Consider personality compatibility
- Look for genuine connection potential
- Select the best 1-3 matches for each person

### Why This Hybrid Approach?

- **Algorithm strength**: Fast, unbiased, data-driven matching
- **Human insight**: Nuanced understanding of personality and chemistry
- **Better outcomes**: Combines the best of both worlds

### What Cupids See

Cupids have access to:

- Your AI-generated profile summary (highlights key traits)
- Your questionnaire responses
- Potential matches with compatibility scores
- Basic profile information (bio, interests, major)

They do NOT see:

- Your email address
- Any contact information
- Your last name initially

#### Reviewing Matches

1. **View Match Candidate Profile**

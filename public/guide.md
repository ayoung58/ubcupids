UBCupids is an anonymous matching service designed for UBC students to find compatible matches for Valentine's Day!

As a user, you can be...

- A match candidate (someone who will be matched with others)

- Or both!

### Key Dates

- **January 17, 2026**: Questionnaire opens, match candidates begin filling out questionnaires.
- **January 31, 2026**: Questionnaire closes, cupids begin reviewing matches
- **February 14, 2026**: Match reveal day! 💘

## Creating Your Account and Profile

### Registration Process

1. **Sign up** with your UBC email address
2. **Verify your email** - check your inbox for the verification link
3. **Complete your profile** with:
   - First name
   - Age
   - Major (optional)
   - Bio (optional)
   - Interests (optional)
   - Other point of contact information (optional)
   - Profile picture (optional)

Next to the Major, Bio, Interests, Point of Contact, and profile picture fields, as a match candidate you'll see that you can select whether or not to show to matches (or to cupids to aid with matching) when matches are revealed. If you do not fill out an addition way to contact you, then those that are matched with you will see your ubc email instead.

If you'd like to be both a match candidate AND a cupid, you will need to sign up for **one** of the accounts, navigate to your profile, and then LINK another account. Then, after filling in necessary info, you'll be able to switch between both accounts via the profile icon!

As a cupid, you can be a cupid for someone of your choosing! Make sure that they have registered as a match candidate too, and then add their student email in your profile OR add their email when signing up.

### Important Notes

- Only **UBC student or alumni email addresses** (@alumni.ubc.ca, @student.ubc.ca) are accepted.
- Your email must be verified before you can fill out the questionnaire
- All of your information is kept confidential, and revealed to matches only if you want to reveal them (other than your name and student email).

## The Questionnaire

The questionnaire is the heart of our matching algorithm. It helps us understand your preferences, values, and what you're looking for in a match.

### Questionnaire Structure

The questionnaire consists of two main sections:

- Section 1 focuses on Lifestyle & Surface Compatibility
- Section 2 focuses on Personality & Interaction Style

### Tips for Filling Out Your Questionnaire

1. **Be honest** - The algorithm works best when you're genuine
2. **Note your preferences and how important they are** - Use these to narrow your search for the one you're looking for. You can mark certain questions as dealbreakers (meanly if they don't match based on this question -- they're out). Or, perhaps a certain question doesn't matter much to you and you're ok with anyone; you can click "No preference" in that case. If a question is more important to you, the algorithm will put more weight on it when scoring that question.
3. **Take your time** - There's no rush, you can save and return later
4. **Be specific** - Open-ended responses help cupids understand you better, and can help your match get to know you better if you discuss during your first meeting!

### Saving Your Progress

- Your responses are auto-saved as you go (though if you need to leave immediately, you can also autosave)
- You can exit and return anytime before the deadline
- Make sure to click submit the questionnaire when you're done! The submit button is on the last question. You can use the question matrix to get there quickly.

⚠️ **Important**: If you don't submit your questionnaire by January 31st, you won't be included in the matching process.

## Understanding the Matching Process

UBCupids uses a unique **hybrid matching system** that combines algorithm scores with human cupid review to offer more matches and variety.

### Algorithm Scoring (Automated)

The algorithm calculates compatibility scores between all participants based on:

- **Response alignment to preferences** - How well-matched are you?
- **Importance weighting** - Prioritizing factors you both care about
- **Deal-breaker filtering** - Ensuring must-haves are met
- **Bidirectional scores** - Both directions of compatibility matter

The algorithm will match all match candidates together and pair them up. This means that if your algorithm match is Person A, then their algorithm match is you!

### Phase 2: Cupid Review (Human Touch)

One or more human cupids will represent you (the match candidate). They will receive the your top five compatible matches. Then, they will choose one of them (or generate more matches if none of them seem to be compatible) to match with you. In doing so, when matches are revealed, the person that the cupid wants to match with you will receive a match request (sort of like sending a friend request on your behalf).

As a cupid, they'll be able to...

- Read profile summaries generated by AI
- Read your profile
- Read your questionnaire responses
- Consider personality compatibility
- Look for genuine connection potential (make sure that the person you want to match with your candidate would like to interact with your candidate as well!)

...that can help you pick out your best match!

Cupids will not have access to

They do NOT see:

- Your email address
- Any contact information
- Your last name initially

## For Cupids: The Matching Portal

Are you a cupid? Thank you for volunteering and signing up! Here's how to use the matching portal effectively.

As a cupid, you will

- Select the best potential matches for your match candidate(s)
- Provide brief rationale for their selections
- Help ensure quality, thoughtful matches

### Using the Matching Portal

The matching portal will not be open until after January 31st (when all match candidates have finished filling out their questionnaires). We will then assign match candidates to cupids, so please do sign up before the 31st!

#### Your Dashboard

- View your assigned match candidates
- Track progress: Pending vs. Reviewed
- Access the matching portal

#### Match Candidate vs. Potential Matches

- **Match Candidate**: The person you're representing (finding matches for them)
- **Potential Matches**: The top 5 algorithm-generated matches for your candidate (you can generate up to 25)

#### Reviewing Matches

1. **View Match Candidate Profile**
   - Read their AI-generated summary and profile
   - Review their questionnaire responses
   - Understand what they're looking for

2. **Browse Potential Matches**
   - Start with 5 matches, reveal more as needed
   - Compare questionnaire responses
   - Look for compatibility and chemistry
   - Consider both profiles holistically

3. **Mark "Not a Match"**
   - Remove matches that clearly won't work
   - Rejections are permanent (even after refresh)
   - Cannot reject the last remaining match

4. **Select Your Top Match**
   - Choose the best potential match
   - Provide brief rationale (they'll see this!)
   - Submit your selection

#### Best Practices for Cupids

✅ **Do:**

- Read both profiles thoroughly
- Consider personality compatibility
- Look for shared values and interests
- Trust your intuition about chemistry
- Provide thoughtful, encouraging rationale

❌ **Don't:**

- Rush through selections
- Focus only on surface-level traits
- Reject too many matches without careful consideration
- Leave generic or unhelpful rationale

#### Understanding the Interface

- **Profile Tab**: View basic information and bio
- **Questionnaire Tab**: See detailed compatibility responses
- **Reveal More**: Load additional potential matches (up to 25 total)
- **Confirm Selection**: Finalize your match choice

We hope you can create some romance this Valentine's Day!

## Match Reveal

### When Are Matches Revealed?

Matches are revealed on **February 8, 2026**!
This is so that matches can have time to plan their meet up (or date!) for Valentine's Day! 💘

### How Many Matches Will I Get?

You'll receive **1+ matches** depending on:

- Availability of highly compatible matches
- Cupid selections
- Algorithm confidence scores

### What Happens at Match Reveal?

There are a few different categories:

1. **Algorithm matches**: This match is a pairing, meaning your match will see your name as well! Thus, you'll see each other's profile blurbs and contact info!
2. **Your cupid's pick**: This is who your cupid chose to send a match request to. You'll be able to see if the person has responded, either accepting your match or declining. If accepted, you'll see their contact information! You'll also be able to see why the cupid thought you'd be compatible
3. **Match requests**: If you have cards in this category, that means other cupids are matching you with their match candidates! You'll want to accept or decline their requests. You'll be able to see the match requests' contact info and profile blurbs, as well as why their cupids thought you would be a great fit with their candidate.

### After the Reveal

If there is mutual interest, email addresses (or other preferred ways of connecting) are shared automatically. It's then up to each of you to connect with your match and make something happen! You're never obligated to reach out or to meet up with your matches; that being said it could be nice to let the other person know what your intention is. If you're declined, we're sorry, it happens to the best of us.

Either way, please be respectful. Remember there's a real person on the other side!

There are cases (ex. based on hard filters and dealbreakers) where you may not have an algorithm match. If that's the case, don't worry. This doesn't mean you aren't compatible with anyone; love comes and goes, and we're sure that you'll click with someone sooner or later!

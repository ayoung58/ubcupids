1. Signed into UBCupids using a match user. Has not started the matching yet. Match screen says: "No Matches Yet We couldn't find compatible matches for you this batch. Don't worry - there's always the next batch!". This is incorrect; if the matching hasn't begun yet, it should say something like "The cupids are working hard behind the scenes to match you up! Matches will be revealed on Feb. 1, stay tuned!"
2. Matches screen does not have a Back to dashboard button.
3. In the Matching portal for cupids, when matching hasn't started yet, it should say "Candidates are filling out their questionnaires -- Cupids will receive a questionnaire on January 27th! Stay tuned till then!" with an hourglass icon instead of the green checkmark and "All Done! You've reviewed all assigned pairs. Great work, Cupid! 💘" message.
4. Please remove the "Matches Created", "Active Proposals", and "Success Rate" sections on the dashboard. Cupids may or may not have multiple candidates, depending on the ratio of cupids to candidates.
5. Remove the "Manage Profile" and "View Match Dashboard" buttons on the bottom of the cupid dashboard (if linked)
6. If someone has not yet completed a questionnaire, they should not be able to click the view matches button (it should be disabled)

All problems above solved.

7. Go to dashboard from homepage also redirects to the match dashboard for cupids?? need to double check.
(Resolved)

Matching:

8. Need to make sure that the section scores for compatibility are also filled in the database (still need to fix)

9. Need to make sure that text comprehension is on for answers of "other" type. 

10. Match assignments to cupids: right now it is assigning PAIRS to cupids. I want to assign ONE candidate to each cupid, and then look at the compability scores of THAT CANDIDATE with everyone else. Take the top five other people that they are compatible with, and then have the cupid choose FOR THEIR REPRESENTATIVE CANDIDATE which of the five would be the best. Also, it would no longer be "approve/disapprove", it would be "Select the best match for you candidate". (Completed)

11. I am not able to click a link and open the questionnaire responses of each of the candidate or who they are matching with (this is needed for cupids to properly match!)

12. Allow cupids to see who they've matched, and remove "show scores" button after they've finished matching.

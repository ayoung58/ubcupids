1. Signed into UBCupids using a match user. Has not started the matching yet. Match screen says: "No Matches Yet We couldn't find compatible matches for you this batch. Don't worry - there's always the next batch!". This is incorrect; if the matching hasn't begun yet, it should say something like "The cupids are working hard behind the scenes to match you up! Matches will be revealed on Feb. 1, stay tuned!"
2. Matches screen does not have a Back to dashboard button.
3. In the Matching portal for cupids, when matching hasn't started yet, it should say "Candidates are filling out their questionnaires -- Cupids will receive a questionnaire on January 27th! Stay tuned till then!" with an hourglass icon instead of the green checkmark and "All Done! You've reviewed all assigned pairs. Great work, Cupid! 💘" message.
4. Please remove the "Matches Created", "Active Proposals", and "Success Rate" sections on the dashboard. Cupids may or may not have multiple candidates, depending on the ratio of cupids to candidates.
5. Remove the "Manage Profile" and "View Match Dashboard" buttons on the bottom of the cupid dashboard (if linked)
6. If someone has not yet completed a questionnaire, they should not be able to click the view matches button (it should be disabled)

All problems above solved.

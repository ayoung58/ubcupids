Questionnaire

For the importance: it would be an importance scale, with a “dealbreaker” button.
For preference: option format is defined (i.e. multi-select, where it would have all the options on the left on the right as well), OR options are listed out, separated by a slash. i.e. [same/similar/different]/doesn’t matter means a “scale” of same, similar, different, with a doesn’t matter button next to it. Default is similar. When the Doesn’t matter button is selected, it would disable the other options AND disable importance.
